LDU Factorization:
LDU Factorization is a matrix factorization technique that expresses a square matrix 𝐴
A as the product of three matrices-
              A = L.D.U

where:
𝐿 is a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal,
𝐷 is a diagonal matrix containing the pivot elements of A,
𝑈 is an upper triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal.

LDU Factorization is useful for simplifying matrix operations in various numerical methods,
particularly in solving linear systems, inverting matrices, and in applications involving stability and conditioning. 
The decomposition allows for efficient computation and is commonly applied in numerical linear algebra.
